<!-- Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

Genetic Algorithms are used to solve optimization problems where there
exists a function to evaluate the fitness of a particular potential solution.

For example, finding the value of a random bitstring given
a fitness function to determine the similarity between a bitstring
and the solution.

In genetics terminology, a potential solution is referred to as a chromosome

To use a Genetic Algorithm, we need a fitness function which
is passed a bitstring, and returns a score that represents the fitness
of the bitstring.

{% highlight csharp %}
public class FitnessHelper{
    // assumes chromosome and solution are bitstrings
    private string solution;
    public double Fitness(string chromosome){
        int editDistance = Compute(chromosome, solution);
        double score = 1.0 / (double) editDistance;

        return score;
    }

    public FitnessHelper(string targetSolution){
        solution = targetSolution;
    }

        for (int j = 0; j <= m; ++j){
            d[j, 0] = j;
