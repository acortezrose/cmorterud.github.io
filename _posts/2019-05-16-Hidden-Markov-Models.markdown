## Introduction
A Hidden Markov Model, or HMM is a special case of a Bayesian Network.

![image](/assets/images/HMM.png "An image of a basic Hidden Markov Model, 3 hidden states, 3 observations")

In the Bayesian Network representation above of a first-order HMM, there are three hidden states, and three observations.
$$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C$$ form the hidden states, and $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ form the observations.
What can we observe from the above graph? We can note that the likelihood
of each observation depends solely upon the likelihood of the hidden
state. Namely, the likelihood of $$a$$ is only determined by the likelihood
of $$A$$, and the likelihood of $$b$$ is conditionally independent
from $$A$$ given the likelihood of $$B$$.
